    <h1> Hello World </h1> 
    <h2> A place I would like to visit </h2>
  
     <p> I would like to visit so many places because the world is so big and beautiful but if I had to choose I would go to London. London seems like a nice place to go to because they have cold weather, I could visit the big ben or ride on the london eye. </p>

    <h2> A person I admire <br> (Past or present) </br> </h2> 
  
    <p> A person that I admire is Ashton IRwin. He is such a positive person and he is so talented, he can play many instruments and is always such an inspiring person always saying the right thing or giving his fans advice on life. I feel like he is such a wise person even though he is very young. </p>
